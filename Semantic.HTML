        <h3>My Life as a Student</h3>
          <article style="background-color:skyblue;height: 80%;">
           <h3>History<h3>
            <p>Since I was 15, I am very interested in computer and how they works 
              with the internet. I always explore the web browser and find 
              out how it works, but I gave up. When I got in college, I was 
              looking for the Information Technology course but sad to say 
              they don't have that course. So I ended taking up Accountancy 
              as my Major. Someone says that you need to be passionate and 
              bold. Always keep learning. You need to  
              stop doing useful things if you don't learn. So the last part 
              to me is the key, especially if you have had some initial 
              success. It becomes even more critical that you have the 
              learning 'bit' always switched on.</p>

           <h3>ARTICLE 2</h3>
           <p>This is the time when I spent my day with my family in the park 
            near the beach. How far you go in life depends on your being tender 
            with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the 
            striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in 
            your life you will have been all of these.</p>

          <h3>ARTICLE 3</h3>
          <p>This is the moment when we went to Cebu City. We go to SM Seaside
             with my family. I was intrigued how people can stand on top 
             of the ice, so we tried it and we had fun. I think it's good 
             to explore it. I don't feel bad about that... I mean, I think 
             everyone has a sense of - has a dark side, has a - carries 
             some sort of pain with them. And I find it fun to crack it 
             open and go there.</p>
