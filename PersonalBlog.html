  <h2>HOME</h2>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my Blog! I am a student of KodeGo taking a Full Stack Web Development.</p>
</section1>

<section2>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I am currently doing my projects for my assignments in KodeGo. We are making an individual project and it makes me want to do more than this current portfolio. And I want to excell in this field and use it for my future job.</p>

<section3>
  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <p>This is about me being a student in KodeGo now. At first, I was worried about not being able to understand a thing and that maybe teachers would'nt take much time with me and would assist only the best students. I was mistaken because in the process they will assist you throughout the whole bootcamp.</p>
